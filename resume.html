<p class="lead">Self employed January of 2001 through October 2010.</p>

<p>Client Work Experience</p>

<p class="lead">Website for local law firm</p>
<p>I was approached by a designer and asked to implement a design into wordpress for this client. I chose to customize the Thesis theme again and implemented their design into the theme.</p>
<p>Technologies Used:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Wordpress</li>
  <li>Thesis theme for Wordpress</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Website for a local pizza franchise</p>
<p>Client approached me with a design in hand and wanted the design turned into a full fledged web site. Current site was static HTML and was difficult to manage if a locations information changed. New site was implemented using Wordpress and Thesis was again chosen for this project. Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://miospizza.com/">miospizza.com</a></p>
<p>Technologies Used:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Wordpress</li>
  <li>Thesis theme for Wordpress</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Coupon Database</p>
<p>The database is coded using PHP to output HTML/JavaScript/jQuery. Different levels of users have different abilities when they login. Users can also upload their logo for inclusion on the coupon database home page. Features a main admin section where administrators can approve/decline users, manage coupons, and also a bulk upload too for administrators to upload a CSV file of new coupons. The admin area is also protected against automated logins using CAPTCHA technology. iFrame for users also ajax for the "report a coupon" functionality so that the user never leaves the web site owners blog or site. Website not in use anymore.</p>

<p>Technologies Used:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>JavaScript/jQuery</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>mySQL</li>
</ul>
<p>The new version of the coupon database supports an iframe that will reload the parent page and load the iframe content. This helps the users as many bloggers are paid by their advertisers on the CPM or cost per 1000 impression basis. Normally iframes will not reload the parent page thus the user can search for coupons but the blogger will not earn a CPM revenue from their site.</p>
